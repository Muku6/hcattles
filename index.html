                        Hello! My name is Heather and I like tinkering and creating. I originally got into learning HTML and crafting my own websites in the late 1990s. I taught myself HTML back then through various methods to be able to create those websites. I had many small projects, but at the time maintained one large project. All but my large project were lost to the sands of time.
                    </p>

                    <p class="para-bottom-spacing">
                        Long story short, I stopped at some point due to various reasons in the early 2000s. It wasn't until January 2022 that I had a bit of an epiphany. I should change career paths. Both exciting and scary, it came as I thought I should go back to web development. Just this time as a career rather than hobby.
                    </p>

                    <p class="para-bottom-spacing">
                        I feel that I've definitely had a jump start on my learning this time around, as throughout the years, despite not making websites, I've used HTML here and there at points so it has always stayed relevant. A lot of changes, new ways to do things, so I'm taking in a lot of these changes. I have also been meaning to learn CSS for the last few years, so this definitely has given me motivation to do so.
                    </p>

                    <p class="para-bottom-spacing">
                        I've used freeCodeCamp specifically to get back into the groove of things. I've had friends, before I started in January, suggest I do it for a couple months before. I used other resources along the way to help reinforce certain parts, but I extensively used freeCodeCamp's legacy and new responsive web design. I got the certificate in the legacy one before it became legacy. Shortly after the new version came out and I finished that as well. I have also completed the Javascript freeCodeCamp course as well.
                    </p>

                    <p class="para-bottom-spacing">
                        There has been a lot to take in, but it has been a fun and exciting experience again. I know there's always more to learn, so I'm looking forward to the journey ahead.

                        My portfolio pieces consist of a lot of work in CodePen, both personal and exercises I've tackled from various sources. It was my introductory place where I felt comfortable. I will be adding pieces to GitHub as I am able.

                    <p class="para-bottom-spacing">
                        I did a lot of protoyping of my personal freelance website on CodePen itself. For designs. Certain aspects. Certain pieces of code. That website is my biggest project since coming back to the scene. You can find that website at <a href="http://rainyday.omc-games.com" target="_blank" id="rda">Rainy Day Art</a>.
